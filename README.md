# Smart-Parking-Space-Detector-using-YOLO-and-OpenCV
This project is an AI-driven car parking monitoring system that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection and OpenCV to detect occupied and free parking spaces in real-time. It enhances parking management by automating vehicle detection and slot monitoring, reducing human effort and errors.
